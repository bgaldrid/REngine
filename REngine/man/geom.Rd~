\title{Create a BML class object}
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~

\description{
  Creates a BML class object given the grid size and car groups. The car groups are given in a tag=value format. The BML format consists of a list with item 1 being the grid size (H,V) and item 2 being a data frame with columns being locations of the different car type. The locations are given as location number in a vector.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
BML(Grid.H,Grid.V,...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Grid.H}{The horizontal grid dimension.}
  \item{Grid.V}{The vertical grid dimension.}
  \item{...}{The locations of different car sets. These should be in the form tag=c(#,#,ect..) or just c(#,#,ect..).}
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}

\details{
If print is used without specifying default S3 method, only the values of the location of the cars will be used.
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
The returned value is a BML object. This object consists of a list of 2 items with the first being the grid dimensions (Horizontal, Vertical) and the second item being a data frame with each column being a different group of cars (i.e. red, blue, ect...).
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
